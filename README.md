# RunScreaming-Game

*RunScreaming* is the codename of our project developed for the 2015 edition of *Game Development & Design* at [TUGraz](https://tugraz.at).

This folder contains our game's *Unity3d* project. For more details check out [our game design document](https://github.com/RunScreaming/gamedo).

## Used Assets & Code

* The code for generating the mazes is taken from http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/maze/. Thanks for allowing us to use it!
* For the Skybox we used [Sky5X One](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/6332) by *RKD* from the Unity Asset store (located in *Run Screaming/Assets/sky5X*)
* For the menues we used [Basic UI Elements: Concrete](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/48833) by *DualCorStudios* from the Uniy Asset Store (not on the repo, you need to install it in order to build the project)

Thanks a lot!
