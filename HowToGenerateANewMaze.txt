HOW 2 GENERATE A MAZE:

1) duplicate "static_maze_0.unity", rename new scene.
2) Open "maze_generator.unity"
3) Click the "play" button
4) Not happy with generated maze? step 3 again!
5) While game is running, switch to "scene" mode and COPY
*"Maze(Clone)" and "Goal(Clone)"
6) Open duplicated scene and replace "Maze(Clone)" with you copied maze.
7) Move the objects around, you can also add some more objects. (prefabs!)
8a) Move "Goal(Clone)" to  a reasonable place. (=edge, because why should the exit be in the middle of the maze?)
8b) Remove wall at exit, so that player1 can see the exit as well.
9) Check generated Screenshots (/Assets/mazePlots/*.png) 
10) test!
11) save scene and push everything to our git repo
