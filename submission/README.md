Abstract:

Help! Your party is running out of cold beer! And your friends agree: You are the chosen
one, chosen to save the night. But now you are on the other side of the city, with the
desired crate of beer, but lost in chaos and disorientation. To run fast and not get
lost at the same time is impossible. And worst of all: the beer is getting warm! In order
to reach the party on time, help is needed! Luckily, the party society is at hand via phone
to guide you … back to the party … to deliver the (hopefully still cold) beer … 
and save the night!

Cheers

```
